# View Docs locally

Run `mkdocs serve` from the root project directory, this starts up a local server to which you can connect using your browser, usually at [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/). The server watches for changes and automatically refreshes the site.

Run `mkdocs gh-deploy` from the root project directory to build and deploy to [github.io](https://georges-circuits.github.io/libprotoserial/).
