# protoserial library

Library intended for rapid prototyping of embedded devices with support of standard interfaces such as USB, UART and RS485. It supports addressing for interfaces where it makes sense and tries to be as modular and easily extensible as possible.

**The library is in a pre-pre-alpha stage right now with no guarantee of API or architectural stability.**


## TODOs
- create standardized "stack" classed that encapsulate all necessary layers and create a protocol stack thats suitable for a given interface
- unite transmit/receive functions' names
- create interface config class
