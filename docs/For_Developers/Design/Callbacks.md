a way to provide one way communication between objects through functions
regardless of the arguments

subject.emit(data, adress, port)
 -> observer1
 ..
 -> observerN

subject can be a separate class from the the object that is actually creating 
the event since the data can be passed into the subjects easily

observers must be member functions of objects since they usually need to keep
their own data and contexts - this is where the problem arises since now we can't
teplate the entire object because observers may want to subscribe to multiple
subjects who each can have different signatures

subjects must be templates of the observer's function signature, or rather 
only such observers can subscribe who match the signature of the subject
